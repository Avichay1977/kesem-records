      <p>
        Kesem Records is a sound design and music production studio
        founded by Avichai Tuchman (DoGBeaT). We specialize in crafting
        sonic experiences that bridge the gap between technology and
        emotion &mdash; from retro funk to classical remixes, from
        electronic beats to cinematic scores.
      </p>

      <h2>DoGBeaT</h2>
      <p>
        Avichay Tuchman, AKA DoGBeaT, is a musician who embodies the
        energy of '80s French disco with the raw power of rock 'n' roll.
        When he's not rocking out with the folk-punk band
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OyDivision" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oy Division</a>,
        you'll find him in the studio, crafting infectious melodies for
        TV series, theater productions, and his own solo projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        A master of multiple instruments and a skilled mix technician,
        Avichay has spent the last decade producing and playing for a
        diverse range of artists, many of whom have become radio regulars.
        His passion for music transcends genre, drawing inspiration from
        everything that grooves and moves the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's not all. Avichay is also a sought-after indie pop
        producer with a Midas touch. He's helped shape the sound of
        numerous Israeli artists, with many of his productions landing
        coveted spots on the nation's most influential playlists.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a knack for blending catchy hooks with unexpected twists,
        DoGBeaT's music is sure to get you moving and leave you wanting more.
